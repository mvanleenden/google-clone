The antennas may extend by rotating about an axis, by reciprocating along their length, or by flexing from a retracted position to an extended position. The electronic device may determine when a removable antenna is attached or detached using signals from the sensors. The electronic device may determine the extent to which an antenna has been extended using signals from the sensors. The electronic device may control the operation of a radio-frequency transceiver that is coupled to the antenna based on signals from the sensors. The electronic device may turn the transceiver off when the antenna is retracted or removed. When the antenna is partially extended, the electronic device may place the transceiver in a low-power mode or place a dual-band transceiver into a single-band mode.",

              "The invention relates to a pure natural apple compound dietary fiber fruit paste which is prepared from the following components in parts by weight: 100 parts of cold broken apple grunt residue, 4-16 parts of apple concentrated juice with soluble solid content of 70%, 2-8 parts of tomato ketchup with the soluble solid content of 30%, 1-2 parts of sesame and 0.01-0.03 part of natural apple essence. The product can be preserved for 16-24 months at normal temperature, thus the retention period of the product is improved by 4-6 times compared with that of the conventional fruit paste dietary fiber; furthermore, the product further contains abundant minerals, polyphenols, lycopene and the like, thereby being an ideal product for supplementing the dietary fiber and anti-aging for middle-aged and aged people; and the pure natural apple compound dietary fiber fruit paste can be taken directly and be used as a smearing agent for breakfast bakery products.",

              "Disclosed are systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable storage media for utilizing a virtual assistant to assist a user with a communication session between the user and a third party service. A user can use a communication application to enter a message directed to the virtual assistant and request assistance to communicate with a 3 rd  party service. In response, the virtual assistant can access a set of communication instructions associated with the 3 rd  party service. The set of communication instructions can include a set of commands for communicating with the 3 rd  party service, services provided by the 3 rd  party service and data needed by the 3 rd  party service to facilitate communication. The virtual assistant can use the communication instructions to gather data needed by the 3 rd  party service, communicate with the 3 rd  party service and present the user with data received from the 3 rd  party service.",
